# quilt_rt

a simple raytracer written in my language, [quilt](https://github.com/nathanielfernandes/quilt).

this was just a fun experiment to see how well quilt could handle a more complex program. it's not very fast, but it works.

supports:

- spheres
- planes
- lights
- shadows
- reflections
- lambertian shading
- phong shading
